Note : For Samsung Gallery I don't think it supports multiple images/videos so for now if the user choose Samsung Gallery as the source, the user can only pick 1 image.

### 4. Change the password

Note : The front capture looks like this because it was taken from an emulator. If you were to download this app and run it, it will take a picture using the front camera.
